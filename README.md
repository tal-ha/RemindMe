# RemindMe
A simple, lightweight WinForm application which loads reminders from an XML file (see sample XML template) and reminds you when the time comes.

##### Motivation
Imagine working at your computer (at home or office) and you don't want distractions so you silent/switch-off your smartphone, but you still need someone to remind you (in a non-intrusive way) of a few things that needs to be done. You want no installation, no accepting terms and conditions, no fancy sync with calendar. Just a plain and simple reminder app.

##### Usage
Simply clone and build the project and use the executable as portable application. Place your reminders XML file in the same directory as the executable.
Note: Ideally, place the .exe file in windows startup.
